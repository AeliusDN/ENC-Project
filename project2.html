        This project was part of a collegewide effort to increase access to education and empower students through open pedagogy. The ultimate purpose of this effort is to achieve greater social justice in our community in which the work can be freely shared with the broader community. 
        This was a renewable assignment that was designed to enable students to become an agent of change in their community through the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Links (UN SDGs). 
      </p>
      <p>
        For this work, we integrated the disciplines of Child Education and Technical Communication to achieve SDG #4: Quality Education. This project involved conducting primary research in the form of interviews and surveys in addition to collecting secondary research.
      </p>
      <p>
        First though, I was put into a team with three other students, and we began working on a team charter. 
        This involved setting clear expectations for what each team member was expected to do, and in what scenarios as well as what type of deliverable we would make, which we decided would be a recommendation report.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, we identified our specific research topic and audience, as well as producing questions that would directly be used for our primary data, such as in our survey and interviews. Speaking of, we next procured our primary and secondary data. 
        The secondary data largely came from the UCF online library, but the primary data was collected via a survey sent out to ENC 1101 and 1102 classes while the interviews were one on one with other UCF writing students. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We then created a draft of our final deliverable and conducted peer reviews with another group of students in our class. After making a couple changes in our format and direction of our recommendation, we began finalizing our project for a final submission. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With the labor divided among each team member, we trusted one another to create each section of the deliverable and checked each other’s work. After submitting, we later received feedback on some minor format changes that we could adjust to make it even better.
        These included adding headings to each major section, breaking paragraphs up to be more digestable and elimating works that we cited but didn't use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was my first experience with working so closely with other people on a research and writing assignment, and I learned a lot about the struggles and techniques that come with working others on such an involved task.

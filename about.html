    <div class="text-field">
      <p>I'm a second year undergraduate student at the University of Central Florida majoring in Computer Science. I started exploring computer science because I wanted to get better at coding to create video games. Specifically, I wanted to be able to make more advanced and optimized systems.</p>

    <div class="text-field">
      <p>I can currently code a little bit of C, as my program requires, but I primarily know Ruby. I learned Ruby while creating video games in the RPG Maker VX Ace engine, which offers a Ruby-based scripting system. 
        I also wrote the HTML that composes this website and first started learning HTML to code my own websites for my ePortfolios for my previous English classes.</p>

    <div class="text-field">
      <p>I enjoy a wide array of personal activities such as archery, blacksmithing, and reading as well as the previously mentioned video game development. I first started learning archery when I was in middle school and have attended several competitions since then. 
        I stopped going to competitions once I entered high school though, due to travel times and availability. Meanwhile, I started learning a bit of blacksmithing partway through high school. 
        I had watched a brief youtube video where one of the contestants, Ilya Alekseyev, forged the "Heretic", a beautiful sword with silver plating and intricate inscriptions, for Bladeshow 2021, which won "Best Sword of the Year". 
        It got me very interested in the art of sword making, so I bought a bunch of books on metallurgy, material science, and traditional forging techniques and began to learn. Later, I went to a local forge and tried forging for the first time and loved it.</p>

    <div class="text-field">
      <p>I also work on modifying pre-existing games, and have made mods for games like Helldivers 2 and Halo Reach. I've become fairly experienced at breaking down pre-existing systems and reworking them to create new encounters, primarily in video games. 
        It's perhaps a bit abtract in some ways, but I enjoy figuring out how systems work and modifying games to be something entirely different. 
        I've probably spent the most time modding Helldivers 2, due to the positive developers and huge modding community, as well as my endless amount of time poured into playing the game itself.</p>

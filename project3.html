        For this assignment, I created a set of written instructions and accompanying visuals. The objective of this assignment was to learn to explain how to divide a complicated task into small tasks and use clear, unambiguous language and meaningful illustrations. 
         I then began writing my instructions, with the assumption that the reader would have a level of experience with the engine already. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-field">
      <p>
        I made my instructions on how to build a real-time event system in RPG Maker VX Ace. I first found an example of a set of instructions that I found useful, which were the original instructions on how to mod titles and images into Helldivers 2, and then decided who my audience would be. 
        I decided that my audience would specifically be novice-advanced RPG Maker VX Ace developers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-field">
      <p>
        After writing out the instructions step by step, I then added the headings, introduction, conclusions, warning, explanation of terms, and list of commands used. Then after that, I added snips of the RPG Maker VX Ave GUI to the instructions and enclosed them in a red border and added red borders around inputs. 
        After formatting all of the images and instructions correctly, I submitted to the peer review.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-field">
      <p>
        I revised the format a bit, resized some of the images, extended some of the steps, and disambiguated some of my language. 
        After the revisions I submitted the final version to the project assignment box where I would get more feedback from before adding it this portfolio. This project really needed a lot of refinement in terms of formatting, as a majority of feedback was again about formatting. 
        After cropping the images better, expanding smaller images to be more legible, and changing the borders to black while leaving the borders around inputs red, I then was able to do the rest of the revision. 
        I cut a few sentences that were unnecessary to an experienced audience, clarified the skill level of the task, rewrote some parts into the second person perspective, moved my warning sections, added more white space between images, and expanded on the explanations for each section.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-field">
      <p>
        I learned that quite a bit of thought must go into the design and layout of a set of instructions, as messing up even a little bit can leave the reader confused and could potentially set them back or discourage them from the task altogether.

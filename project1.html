        For this assignment, I made a resume and cover letter for a prospective internship. The objective of this assignment was for me to learn to describe my experiences and qualifications clearly, succinctly, and in a way that appeals to prospective employers. 
        The most important thing was that my resume and cover letter were error-free and easy to read though. 
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I found the internship listing on Indeed, then I began writing my resume. 
        I put all of my educational experience into it, as well as personal skills and teams to show off what I could do. Afterwards, I found a couple templates on Google and used the techniques and formats from them to create a streamlined, easy to read format for my own resume. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I started writing my cover letter, where I highlighted in more conversational detail what I’ve done and how my skills could benefit the company I was applying for. 
        I tied the skills in my resume into my cover letter and expanded on how I got those skills and why they were useful, as well as things that I had made with them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They were then submitted for peer review, where I made a couple minor layout changes in the resume and restructured some sentences in the cover letter to read a bit better.
      </p>
      <p>
        After final grading, I received feedback on how to make them even better. The feedback, and the revisions I made for this version, consisted largely of improving my language and enhancing the clarity of what I was trying to communicate with my skills. 
        There were a couple minor changes to the formatting of my resume as well, like clarifying dates and maintaining bullet point format across sections. The revisions didn’t take very long, due to my final submission being very refined to start with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project taught me quite a bit about how to formally create an application that's appealing to employers. Largely, no one else in life really teaches you how to do this, and these skills could be the difference between getting hired or passed on.
